abstract = {This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression Ev(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+n(r), nn01, and (2) n(r)=(rr0) with arbitrary and r0→. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented. {\textcopyright} 1964 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Fast and accurate molecular force field (FF) parameterization is still an unsolved problem. Accurate FFs are not generally available for all molecules, like novel druglike molecules. While methods based on quantum mechanics (QM) exist to parameterize them with better accuracy, they are computationally expensive and slow, which limits applicability to a small number of molecules. Here, we present an automated FF parameterization method which can utilize either DFT calculations or approximate QM energies produced by different neural network potentials (NNPs), to obtain improved parameters for molecules. We demonstrate that for the case of torchani-ANI-1x NNP, we can parameterize small molecules in a fraction of time compared with an equivalent parameterization using DFT QM calculations while producing more accurate parameters than FF (GAFF2). We expect our method to be of critical importance in computational structure-based drug discovery. The current version is available at PlayMolecule (www.playmolecule.org) and implemented in HTMD, allowing to parameterize molecules with different QM and NNP options.},

abstract = {We present the construction of molecular force fields for small molecules (less than 25 atoms) using the recently developed symmetrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) approach [Chmiela et al., Nat. Commun. 9, 3887 (2018) and Chmiela et al., Sci. Adv. 3, e1603015 (2017)]. This approach is able to accurately reconstruct complex high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces from just a few 100s of molecular conformations extracted from ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. The data efficiency of the sGDML approach implies that atomic forces for these conformations can be computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches, such as the “gold standard” coupled-cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML model recovers local and non-local electronic interactions (e.g., H-bonding, proton transfer, lone pairs, changes in hybridization states, steric repulsion, and n → $\pi$ * interactions) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML molecular dynamics trajectories yields new qualitative insights into dynamics and spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic accuracy.},

abstract = {Calculating the electronic structure of molecules and solids has become an important pillar of modern research in diverse fields of research from biology and materials science to chemistry and physics. Unfortunately, increasingly accurate and thus reliable approximate solution schemes to the underlying Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation scale steeply in computational cost, rendering most accurate approaches like “gold standard” coupled cluster theory, CC, quickly intractable for larger systems of interest. Here we show that this scaling can be significantly reduced by applying machine-learning to the CC correlation energy. We introduce a vector-based representation of CC wave functions and use potential energy surfaces of a small molecule test set to learn the correlation energy from this representation. Our results show that the CC correlation energy can be efficiently learned, even when the representation is constructed from approximate amplitudes provided by computationally less demanding M{\o}ller–Plesset (MP2) pertur...},

abstract = {Solving the coupled-cluster (CC) equations is a cost-prohibitive process that exhibits poor scaling with system size. These equations are solved by determining the set of amplitudes (t) that minimize the system energy with respect to the coupled-cluster equations at the selected level of truncation. Here, a novel approach to predict the converged coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) amplitudes, thus the coupled-cluster wave function, is explored by using machine learning and electronic structure properties inherent to the MP2 level. Features are collected from quantum chemical data, such as orbital energies, one-electron Hamiltonian, Coulomb, and exchange terms. The data-driven CCSD (DDCCSD) is not an alchemical method because the actual iterative coupled-cluster equations are solved. However, accurate energetics can also be obtained by bypassing solving the CC equations entirely. Our preliminary data show that it is possible to achieve remarkable speedups in solving the CCSD equations, especially when the correct physics are encoded and used for training of machine learning models. C oupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) has become the "gold standard" in computational chemistry because it can provide accurate electronic energies and properties for molecules with a single-reference ground state. 1,2 The CCSD(T) scheme has been applied in a plethora of computational studies for the calculation of accurate atomization energies, 3,4 reaction barriers, 5−7 noncovalent interactions, 8,9 and more. However, conventional CCSD(T) is a computationally intensive method in terms of CPU time and disk space, which limits its applicability to small-and medium-size molecular systems; a large basis close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit is needed to achieve the expected accuracy. Solutions to the slow convergence with respect to the basis set include extrapolation schemes 3,10−13 and addition of two-electron functions that explicitly depend on the interelectronic r 12 distance (explicitly correlated methods or R12/F12 methods). 14−17 Alternative methodologies that speed-up CC schemes are exploration of the locality of electron excitations, 18 fragmentation schemes, 19,20 pair-natural orbital (PNO) expansions, 21−25 linear scaling methods, 26 and high-performance computing. 27 Herein, we present a novel approach toward implementing low-cost, highly accurate CC calculations through machine learning (ML). The data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) scheme uses ML for accurate prediction of the double excitation amplitudes, t ij ab. A new wave function is generated that aims to replicate the converged CCSD wave function. The machine-learned wave function can be used either directly for accurate CCSD-level observables, such as energy, at MP2-level cost, or as an improved guess for the t ij ab amplitudes, which reduces the number of iterations to converge the CCSD equations. In recent years, ML has had an increased role in chemistry as a promising technique because it is fast and scalable for a broad range of applications. ML has been widely applied in determining potential energy surfaces 28−40 and has been recently applied as an efficient method for screening the chemical space for quantum-level accuracy prediction and materials discovery. 41−47 Achieving quantum-level accuracy at low computational cost has received much attention due to developments in machine-learnable molecular representations such as Coulomb matrices, 48 Bag-of-Bonds, 49 and many other fingerprinting methods. 50−57 However, these methods ultimately rely on mapping molecular geometries to properties, which can require extensive amounts of training data and may have limited transferability between systems. Additionally, this may require optimization of chemical structures in order to properly relate molecular structure to function. In contrast to mapping properties from molecular structure, ML has been also used to improve the electronic structure description directly. For density functional theory (DFT)-based approaches, ML has been applied to directly learn the electron density and for the development of exchange− correlation functionals. 58−61 Recently, there have also been developments in applying ML to wave function-based},

abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Alml{\"{o}}f, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml{\"{o}}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99{\%} of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50{\%} more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94{\%}–97{\%} of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

With the aim of maximizing transferability across chemical systems and compactness of the feature set, we avoid the usual specification of ML features in terms of atom-or geometry-specific information, such atom/element-types, bond-types, or local molecular structure. ML predictions of MP2 and CCSD energies are presented for a range of systems, demonstrating that the method maintains accuracy while providing transferability both within and across chemical families; this includes predictions for molecules with atom-types and elements that are not included in the training set.

abstract = {The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT. The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental quantity of interest.},

Inspired by these successes, researchers are now applying deep generative modeling techniques to the generation and optimization of molecules - in our review we found 45 papers on the subject published in the past two years. These works point to a future where such systems will be used to generate lead molecules, greatly reducing resources spent downstream synthesizing and characterizing bad leads in the lab. In this review we survey the increasingly complex landscape of models and representation schemes that have been proposed. The four classes of techniques we describe are recursive neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning. After first discussing some of the mathematical fundamentals of each technique, we draw high level connections and comparisons with other techniques and expose the pros and cons of each. Several important high level themes emerge as a result of this work, including the shift away from the SMILES string representation of molecules towards more sophisticated representations such as graph grammars and 3D representations, the importance of reward function design, the need for better standards for benchmarking and testing, and the benefits of adversarial training and reinforcement learning over maximum likelihood based training.},

At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: GROMACS is an open source and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

MLCI is then used to find compact wavefunctions for carbon monoxide at both stretched and equilibrium geometries. We also consider the multireference problem of the water molecule with elongated bonds. Results are contrasted with those from other ways of selecting configurations: first-order perturbation, random selection and Monte Carlo configuration interaction. Compared with these other serial calculations, this prototype MLCI is competitive in its accuracy, converges in significantly fewer iterations than the stochastic approaches, and requires less time for the higher-accuracy computations.},

abstract = {We review the current state of reduced-scaling electron correlation methods, particularly coupled-cluster theory for the simulation and prediction of molecular response properties. The successes of local-coupled-cluster and related approaches are well known for reaction energies, thermodynamic constants, dipole moments, and so forth—properties that depend primarily on the quality of the ground-state wave function. However, much more challenging are higher-order properties such as polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, optical rotations, magnetizabilities, and others that also require accurate representation of the derivative of the wave function to external electromagnetic fields. We discuss a range of methods for improving the correlation domains of such perturbed wave functions, including the use of “perturbation-aware” natural orbitals that are customized for the property of interest. In addition, we consider the viability and potential of promising, but still-emerging methods such as stochastic and real-time coupled-cluster approaches, for which the localizability of the field-dependent wave function may be more controllable than for conventional response theory.

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to predict molecular prop- erties in a high-throughput setting at a much lower computational cost than con- ventional electronic structure calculations. Such ML models require descriptors that encode the molecular structure in a vector. These descriptors are generally designed to respect the symmetries and invariances of the target property. However, size- extensivity is usually not guaranteed for so-called global descriptors. In this contri- bution, we show how extensivity can be build into ML models with global descriptors such as the Many-Body Tensor Representation. Properties of extensive and non- extensive models for the atomization energy are systematically explored by training on small molecules and testing on small, medium and large molecules. Our result shows that the non-extensive model is only useful in the size-range of its training set, whereas the extensive models provide reasonable predictions across large size differences. Remaining sources of error for the extensive models are discussed.},

abstract = {The development of electronic response theory in quantum chemistry has been reviewed, starting from the early 1970's and reaching the current state-of-the-art. The general theory has been applied to the calculation of a large number of spectroscopic parameters over the years, and it has been implemented for the majority of standard electronic structure methods. Two formulations of response theory, the Ehrenfest expectation value and the quasi-energy derivative formulation, have turned into leading alternatives for the derivation of computationally tractable expressions of response functions, and they are here reviewed with an attempt to, as far as possible, leave out technical details. A set of four steps are identified as common in derivations of response functions, and the two formulations are compared along this series of steps. Particular emphasis is given to the situation when the oscillation of the weak external electromagnetic field is in resonance with a transition frequency of the system. The formation of physically sound response functions in resonance regions of the spectrum is discussed in light of the causality condition and the Kramers-Kronig relations, and it is achieved in wave function theory by means of the introduction of relaxation parameters in a manner that mimics what one sees in density matrix theory. As a working example, equations are illustrated by their application to a two-state model for para-nitroaniline including the ground and the lowest charge-transfer state in the electric dipole approximation.},

The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.},

abstract = {We address the degree to which machine learning (ML) can be used to accurately and transferably predict post-Hartree-Fock correlation energies. Refined strategies for feature design and selection are presented, and the molecular-orbital-based machine learning (MOB-ML) method is applied to several test systems. Strikingly, for the second-order M{\o}ller-Plessett perturbation theory, coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD), and CCSD with perturbative triples levels of theory, it is shown that the thermally accessible (350 K) potential energy surface for a single water molecule can be described to within 1 mhartree using a model that is trained from only a single reference calculation at a randomized geometry. To explore the breadth of chemical diversity that can be described, MOB-ML is also applied to a new dataset of thermalized (350 K) geometries of 7211 organic models with up to seven heavy atoms. In comparison with the previously reported $\Delta$-ML method, MOB-ML is shown to reach chemical accuracy with threefold fewer training geometries. Finally, a transferability test in which models trained for seven-heavy-atom systems are used to predict energies for thirteen-heavy-atom systems reveals that MOB-ML reaches chemical accuracy with 36-fold fewer training calculations than $\Delta$-ML (140 vs 5000 training calculations).},

@article{Schutt2019,
abstract = {Machine learning advances chemistry and materials science by enabling large-scale exploration of chemical space based on quantum chemical calculations. While these models supply fast and accurate predictions of atomistic chemical properties, they do not explicitly capture the electronic degrees of freedom of a molecule, which limits their applicability for reactive chemistry and chemical analysis. Here we present a deep learning framework for the prediction of the quantum mechanical wavefunction in a local basis of atomic orbitals from which all other ground-state properties can be derived. This approach retains full access to the electronic structure via the wavefunction at force field-like efficiency and captures quantum mechanics in an analytically differentiable representation. On several examples, we demonstrate that this opens promising avenues to perform inverse design of molecular structures for target electronic property optimisation and a clear path towards increased synergy of machine learning and quantum chemistry.},

The remainder of the wave function is given in terms of a series of cluster functions. The overlap integral between the correct wave functions and the Slater determinant is small and depends on the higher cluster functions in a complicated manner. Nevertheless we can show that the one- and two-body density matrices are well approximated by expressions involving only the single-particle wave functions and the two-body cluster functions. The Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation yields a coupled set of equations which determine the cluster functions as well as the single-particle wave functions. {\textcopyright} 1960.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing classical force fields constitute the cornerstone of contemporary atomistic modeling in chemistry, biology, and materials science. However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations.},
