\abstract{
The efficient computation of dynamic (time-dependent) molecular properties is
a broad field with numerous applications in aiding molecular synthesis and
design, with a particular prevalence in spectroscopic predictions. 
Typical methods for computing the response of a molecular system to
an electromagnetic field (EMF) considers a quantum mechanical description
of the molecule and a classical approximation for the EMF. Methods
for describing light-matter interactions with high-accuracy electronic 
structure methods, such as coupled cluster (CC), are discussed, with a focus on 
improving the efficiency of such methods.\\
The CC method suffers from high-degree polynomial scaling.
In addition to the ground-state calculation, computing dynamic properties 
requires the description of sensitive excited-state effects. 
The cost of such methods often prohibits the accurate calculation
of response properties for systems of significant importance, such
as large-molecule drug candidates or chiral species present in biological
systems. While the literature is ripe with reduced-scaling methods
for CC ground-state calculations, considerably fewer approaches
have been applied to excited-state properties, with even fewer still
providing adequate results for realistic systems. This work presents
three studies on the reduction of the cost of molecular property
evaluations, in the hopes of closing this gap in the literature and
widening the scope of current theoretical methods.\\
There are two main ways of simulating time-dependent light-matter
interactions: one may consider these effects in the frequency domain,
where the response of the system to an EMF is computed directly; or, the
response may be considered explicitly in the time domain, where wave
function (or density) parameters can be propagated in time and examined in detail.
Each methodology has unique advantages and computational bottlenecks.
The first two studies focus on frequency-domain calculations, and employ
fragmentation and machine-learning techniques to reduce the cost of
single-molecule calculations or sets of calculations across a series of
geometric conformations. The third study presents a novel application of
the local correlation technique to real-time CC calculations, and highlights
deficiencies and possible solutions to the approach.

Theoretical chemistry plays a key role in connecting experimental results
with physical interpretation. Paramount to the success of theoretical
methods is the ability to predict molecular properties without the need for
costly high-throughput synthesis, aiding in the determination of molecular
structure and the design of new materials. Light-matter interactions,
which govern spectroscopic techniques, are particularly complicated,
and sensitive to the theoretical tools employed in their prediction.
Compounding the issue of accuracy is one of efficiency --- accurate
theoretical methods typically incur steep scaling of computational cost
(memory and processor time) with respect to the size of the system.\\
An important aspect in improving the efficiency of these methods is
understanding the nature of light-matter interactions at a quantum
level. Many unanswered questions still remain, such as, ``Can light-matter
interactions be thought of as a sum of interactions between smaller
fragments of the system?'' and ``Can conventional methods of accelerating
ground-state calculations be expected to perform well for spectroscopic
properties?'' The present work seeks to answer these questions through
three studies, focusing on improving the efficiency of these techniques,
while simultaneously addressing their fundamental flaws and providing
reasonable alternatives.
