abstract = {The frozen-virtual natural-orbital (NO) approach, whereby the unoccupied-orbital space is constructed using a correlated density such as that from many-body perturbation theory, has proven to yield compact wave functions for determining ground-state correlation energies and associated properties, with corresponding occupation numbers providing a guide to the truncation of the virtual space. In this work this approach is tested for the first time for the calculation of higher-order response properties, particularly frequency-dependent dipole polarizabilities using coupled-cluster theory. We find that such properties are much more sensitive to the truncation of virtual space in the NO basis than in the original canonical molecular orbital (CMO) basis, with truncation errors increasing linearly with respect to the number of frozen virtual NOs. The reasons behind this poor performance include the more diffuse nature of NOs with low occupation numbers as well as the reduction in sparsity of the perturbed singl...},

At variance with previous investigations of this kind, the virtual subspace is represented in atomic orbitals. This allows to define spatial relations between the orbitals involved. Typically, over 98{\%} of the pair correlation energy is recovered by a small local basis set, consisting of the valence orbitals of the atoms with which the electron pair is associated. This opens the possibility of an efficient Cl procedure based on localized pairs. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Alml{\"{o}}f, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml{\"{o}}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99{\%} of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50{\%} more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94{\%}–97{\%} of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

We first provide an overview of ground-state coupled cluster theory and the analytic derivative approach to computing time-independent properties, and then extend this to time-dependent perturbations. Through the well-established ``quasi-energy'' approach, we demonstrate the connection between the analytic derivative and response approaches, emphasizing the usefulness of the latter for frequency-dependent chiroptical properties. In addition, we review successes of response theory in the prediction of gas-phase specific rotations and electronic circular dichroism spectra for small molecules and the physical requirements of a robust computational model of such properties. We also discuss the many challenges of extending this reliability to solvated systems through several key examples for which theory and experiment diverge significantly.},

abstract = {The curse of dimensionality (COD) limits the current state-of-the-art ab initio propagation methods for non-relativistic quantum mechanics to relatively few particles. For stationary structure calculations, the coupled-cluster (CC) method overcomes the COD in the sense that the method scales polynomially with the number of particles while still being size-consistent and extensive. We generalize the CC method to the time domain while allowing the single-particle functions to vary in an adaptive fashion as well, thereby creating a highly flexible, polynomially scaling approximation to the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. The method inherits size-consistency and extensivity from the CC method. The method is dubbed orbital-adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster, and is a hierarchy of approximations to the now standard multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for fermions.

abstract = {Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra are able to provide insights into the geometric, electronic, and magnetic properties of chemical systems. However, they can be challenging to understand and simulate given the need to simultaneously treat both the finite magnetic and optical fields. Thus, efficient simulations are desired to understand the spectra and resolve the molecular electronic states. Real-time dynamics are used widely in the simulation of electronic spectroscopies such as absorption as well as electronic circular dichroism, but simulating MCD with real-time dynamics is technically and theoretically challenging. In this work, we introduce a real-time dynamics-based ab initio method with a nonperturbative treatment of a static magnetic field with London orbitals for simulating the MCD spectra of closed shell systems. Effects of a magnetic field are included variationally in the spin-free nonrelativistic Hamiltonian. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory dynamics are then performed, from which we compute the response function in the presence of the external magnetic field, giving the MCD spectrum. The method developed in this paper is applied to simulate the MCD spectra for pyrimidine, pyrazine, and 1,4-naphthoquinone. Results are discussed and compared to the experiment.},

abstract = {Coupled-electron pair approximations (CEPAs) and coupled-pair functionals (CPFs) have been popular in the 1970s and 1980s and have yielded excellent results for small molecules. Recently, interest in CEPA and CPF methods has been renewed. It has been shown that these methods lead to competitive thermochemical, kinetic, and structural predictions. They greatly surpass second order M{\o}ller-Plesset and popular density functional theory based approaches in accuracy and are intermediate in quality between CCSD and CCSD(T) in extended benchmark studies. In this work an efficient production level implementation of the closed shell CEPA and CPF methods is reported that can be applied to medium sized molecules in the range of 50-100 atoms and up to about 2000 basis functions. The internal space is spanned by localized internal orbitals. The external space is greatly compressed through the method of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) that was also introduced by the pioneers of the CEPA approaches. Our implementation also makes extended use of density fitting (or resolution of the identity) techniques in order to speed up the laborious integral transformations. The method is called local pair natural orbital CEPA (LPNO-CEPA) (LPNO-CPF). The implementation is centered around the concepts of electron pairs and matrix operations. Altogether three cutoff parameters are introduced that control the size of the significant pair list, the average number of PNOs per electron pair, and the number of contributing basis functions per PNO. With the conservatively chosen default values of these thresholds, the method recovers about 99.8{\%} of the canonical correlation energy. This translates to absolute deviations from the canonical result of only a few kcal mol-1. Extended numerical test calculations demonstrate that LPNO-CEPA (LPNO-CPF) has essentially the same accuracy as parent CEPA (CPF) methods for thermochemistry, kinetics, weak interactions, and potential energy surfaces but is up to 500 times faster. The method performs best in conjunction with large and flexible basis sets. These results open the way for large-scale chemical applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a time-domain time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) approach to calculate frequency-dependent polarizability and hyperpolarizabilities. In this approach, the electronic degrees of freedom are propagated within the density matrix based TDDFT framework using the efficient modified midpoint and unitary transformation algorithm. We use monochromatic waves as external perturbations and apply the finite field method to extract various orders of the time-dependent dipole moment. By fitting each order of time-dependent dipole to sinusoidal waves with harmonic frequencies, one can obtain the corresponding (hyper)polarizability tensors. This approach avoids explicit Fourier transform and therefore does not require long simulation time.

abstract = {High harmonic generation (HHG) is an extremely nonlinear effect generating coherent broadband radiation and pulse durations reaching attosecond timescales. Conventional models of HHG that treat the driving and emitted fields classically are usually very successful but inherently cannot capture the quantum-optical nature of the process. Although prior work considered quantum HHG, it remains unknown in what conditions the spectral and statistical properties of the radiation depart considerably from the known phenomenology of HHG. The discovery of such conditions could lead to novel sources of attosecond light having squeezing and entanglement. Here, we present a fully-quantum theory of extreme nonlinear optics, predicting quantum effects that alter both the spectrum and photon statistics of HHG, thus departing from all previous approaches. We predict the emission of shifted frequency combs and identify spectral features arising from the breakdown of the dipole approximation for the emission. Our results show that each frequency component of HHG can be bunched and squeezed and that each emitted photon is a superposition of all frequencies in the spectrum, i.e., each photon is a comb. Our general approach is applicable to a wide range of nonlinear optical processes, paving the way towards novel quantum phenomena in extreme nonlinear optics.},

The problem of the numerical integration of the equations of motion is considered, and a critical evaluation of the standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme and the symplectic Gauss integrator of variable order are given, including several illustrative numerical experiments. While the Gauss integrator is stable even for laser pulses well above the perturbation limit, our experiments indicate that a system-dependent upper limit exists for the external field strengths. Above this limit, time-dependent coupled-cluster calculations become very challenging numerically, even in the full configuration interaction limit. The source of these numerical instabilities is shown to be rapid increases of the amplitudes as ultrashort high-intensity laser pulses pump the system out of the ground state into states that are virtually orthogonal to the static Hartree-Fock reference determinant.},

The conventional time-independent CC formulation for excited states is the equation-of-motion (EOM-CC) method whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe the core excited states. An alternative computational procedure is offered by a time-dependent CC description. In that case, the dipole transition operator is expressed in the CC effective Hamiltonian form and propagated with respect to time. The absorption spectrum is obtained from the CC dipole autocorrelation function via a Fourier transformation. Comparisons are made among the time-dependent results obtained from second-order perturbation theory, to coupled cluster doubles and their linearized forms (CCD and LCCD), to CC singles and doubles (CCSD) and the linearized form (LCCSD). In the time-independent case, considerations of triples (EOM-CCSDT) and quadruples (EOM-CCSDTQ) are used to approach sub-electron volt accuracy. A particular target is the allyl radical, as an example of an open-shell molecule. As the results have to ultimately be the same, the two procedures offer a complementary approach toward analyzing experimental results.},

abstract = {We introduce an inherently real coupled cluster time-dependent expectation value of a Hermitian operator. Based on the expansion of this expectation value in orders of the generally time-dependent perturbation, we subsequently identify the coupled cluster time-independent expectation value, the linear response function, and the quadratic response function. The response functions and their residues behave physically correctly. Spectroscopic observables are identified as residues, whereas the identification of individual transition matrix elements is prohibited. Thus the unphysical behavior of previously published coupled cluster response functions may be viewed not as a consequence of the projection, but rather that identifications are made on the basis of an unphysical expectation value or quasienergy.},

Higher levels give increased accuracy at increased computational effort. The scaling of CCS, CC2, CCSD, CC3 and CCSDT is N4, N5, N6, N7and N8, respectively where N is th the number of orbitals.

abstract = {In this work, we present two compact basis sets optimized for the calculation of specific rotation: augD-3-21G and augT3-3-21G. They are obtained by combining the standard 3-21G basis set with the diffuse functions of aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ, respectively, followed by a reoptimization of the exponents of the diffuse functions. The exponent optimization is based on minimization of the root-mean-square relative error (RMSE) of the specific rotation computed at 589.3 nm (the sodium D line, [$\alpha$]D) with CAM-B3LYP compared with the corresponding calculations using the full correlation-consistent basis sets. The training set comprises 21 chiral molecules with |[$\alpha$]D| {\textgreater} 50 deg dm-1 (g/mL)-1. For augT3-3-21G, the functions with the highest angular momentum are neglected, so that augD-3-21G and augT3-3-21G are of the same size. The exponents are optimized for four common elements in chiral organic molecules (H, C, N, and O), while the original exponents are maintained for other elements. Tests are conducted on the training set with CAM-B3LYP at 450 and 633 nm and with B3LYP at 589.3 nm; furthermore, a similar comparison is performed on a control set containing 30 more chiral molecules. A comparison with the optical rotatory prediction (ORP) basis set is also presented. The results show that the new compact basis sets are able to reproduce the calculations with the full Dunning basis sets remarkably well, and definitely better than before reoptimization of the exponents, with relative mean unsigned errors of around 4{\%}. More significantly, augT3-3-21G is either of similar quality or better than aug-cc-pVDZ in reproducing the values obtained with aug-cc-pVTZ, even though augT3-3-21G is smaller than aug-cc-pVDZ. The larger ORP basis set outperforms both augT3-3-21G and aug-cc-pVDZ, but it requires a considerably larger computational effort. In summary, augT3-3-21G provides results that are in very good agreement with those obtained using aug-cc-pVTZ, but approximately 20 times faster, and it may be used for quick and reliable calculations of specific rotation of large chiral molecules.},

This field of research has experienced an impetuous growth in recent years, due to the technological progress in the generation of ultrashort light pulses and to the development of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques, which greatly increase the amount of information on the process under study. This paper aims at providing a non-exhaustive overview of the state of the art of the field and at pointing out future challenges. We first review the progress in ultrafast optics, which has enabled the generation of broadly tunable light pulses with duration down to a few optical cycles; we then discuss the pump-probe technique, showing examples of its capability to combine very high time resolution, down to the attosecond regime, with broad spectral coverage; we introduce two-dimensional spectroscopy and present results that demonstrate the additional information content provided by the combination of temporal and spectral resolution. Next, we review the achievements of ultrafast X-ray and electron diffraction, which provide time-dependent structural information on photochemical processes, and we conclude with a critical analysis of the future open challenges in the field.},

@article{McAlexander2016,
abstract = {We have investigated the performance of the reduced-scaling coupled cluster method based on projected atomic orbitals (PAOs), pair natural orbitals (PNOs), and orbital specific virtuals (OSVs) for the prediction of linear response properties. These methods introduce different degrees of controllable sparsity in the ground-state and perturbed coupled cluster wave functions, leading to localization errors in properties such as dynamic polarizabilities and specific optical rotations. Using a series of chiral test compounds, we find that the inherent costs associated with computing response properties are significantly greater than those for determining the ground-state energy. As the dimensionality of the molecular system increases-from (pseudo)linear structures, such as fluoroalkanes, to cagelike structures, such as $\beta$-pinene-the crossover point between canonical-orbital and localized-orbital algorithms increases substantially. Furthermore, both the OSV and PNO methods provide greater reduction in cost (as measured by the size of the double-excitation space) than do PAOs, and PNOs provide the greatest level of sparsity for the systems examined here. Single-excitation truncation induces much larger errors than corresponding doubles truncation due to the fact that the first-order contribution to the one-electron perturbed wave function appears in the singles amplitudes. Both the PNO and OSV methods perform reasonably well for frequency-dependent polarizabilities provided appropriate thresholds are used for the occupation-number and weak-pair cutoffs on which each method depends. Specific rotations, however, are very sensitive to wave function truncation, to the extent that aggressive thresholds can yield the incorrect sign of the rotation, due to the delicate balance of positive and negative wave function contributions to the mixed electric-/magnetic-field response.},

The ``correlation domain'' selection schemes that have yielded great success for computations of ground-state energies are found to be inadequate for field-response properties, including polarizabilities, excitation energies, and transition probabilities. Alternative approaches for expanding the venerated Boughton---Pulay orbital domains are considered, including the use of the first-order orbital response via the coupled-perturbed Hartree---Fock equations. Applications of these selection schemes to frequency-dependent dipole-polarizabilities and optical rotation in chiral species demonstrate that local correlation methods have great promise for such properties for large molecules.},

abstract = {We report an explicitly time-dependent approach to the generation of linear absorption spectra for molecular systems within the framework of equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) theory. While most time-dependent CC approaches consider the perturbation and time-evolution of a CC wave function, the present work considers the time-evolution of a CC dipole function. The dipole function formalism introduces no approximations and requires the evolution of only one time-dependent quantity, either the left or right dipole function. This time-dependent framework can be used to compute linear absorption spectra for molecules with a high density of states over a broad spectral range, a case for which conventional frequency-domain computations may become impractical. We validate the approach by comparing absorption spectra for small molecules computed at EOM second-order approximate CC (CC2) and time-dependent EOM-CC2 (TD-EOM-CC2) levels of theory. TD-EOM-CC2 computations are also used to predict extreme ultraviolet absorption spectra for third-row ions that are in reasonable agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {The development of electronic response theory in quantum chemistry has been reviewed, starting from the early 1970's and reaching the current state-of-the-art. The general theory has been applied to the calculation of a large number of spectroscopic parameters over the years, and it has been implemented for the majority of standard electronic structure methods. Two formulations of response theory, the Ehrenfest expectation value and the quasi-energy derivative formulation, have turned into leading alternatives for the derivation of computationally tractable expressions of response functions, and they are here reviewed with an attempt to, as far as possible, leave out technical details. A set of four steps are identified as common in derivations of response functions, and the two formulations are compared along this series of steps. Particular emphasis is given to the situation when the oscillation of the weak external electromagnetic field is in resonance with a transition frequency of the system. The formation of physically sound response functions in resonance regions of the spectrum is discussed in light of the causality condition and the Kramers-Kronig relations, and it is achieved in wave function theory by means of the introduction of relaxation parameters in a manner that mimics what one sees in density matrix theory. As a working example, equations are illustrated by their application to a two-state model for para-nitroaniline including the ground and the lowest charge-transfer state in the electric dipole approximation.},

abstract = {A production level implementation of the closed-shell local quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster methods with single and double excitations (QCISD and CCSD) based on the concept of pair natural orbitals [local pair natural orbital LPNO-QCISD and LPNO-CCSD) is reported, evaluated, and discussed. This work is an extension of the earlier developed LPNO coupled-electron pair approximation (LNPO-CEPA) method [F. Neese, Chem. Phys. 130, 114108 (2009)] and makes extended use of the resolution of the identity (RI) or density fitting (DF) approximation. Two variants of each method are compared. The less accurate approximations (LPNO2 -QCISD/ LPNO 2 -CCSD) still recover 98.7{\%}-99.3{\%} of the correlation energy in the given basis and have modest disk space requirements. The more accurate variants (LPNO1 -QCISD/ LPNO1 -CCSD) typically recover 99.75{\%}-99.95{\%} of the correlation energy in the given basis but require the Coulomb and exchange operators with up to two-external indices to be stored on disk. Both variants have comparable computational efficiency. The convergence of the results with respect to the natural orbital truncation parameter (TCutPNO) has been studied. Extended numerical tests have been performed on absolute and relative correlation energies as function of basis set size and TCutPNO as well as on reaction energies, isomerization energies, and weak intermolecular interactions. The results indicate that the errors of the LPNO methods compared to the canonical QCISD and CCSD methods are below 1 kcal/mol with our default thresholds. Finally, some calculations on larger molecules are reported (ranging from 40-86 atoms) and it is shown that for medium sized molecules the total wall clock time required to complete the LPNO-CCSD calculations is only two to four times that of the preceding self-consistent field (SCF). Thus these methods are highly suitable for large-scale computational chemistry applications. Since there are only three thresholds involved that have been given conservative default values, the methods can be confidentially used in a "black- box" fashion in the same way as their canonical counterparts. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

abstract = {The Dirac variation-of-constants method has long provided a basis for perturbative solution of the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. In spite of its widespread utilization, certain aspects of the method have been discussed only superficially and remain somewhat obscure. The present review attempts to clarify some of these points, particularly those related to secular and normalization terms. Secular terms arise from an over-all time-dependent phase in the wave function, while normalization terms preserve the norm of the wave function. A proper treatment of the secular terms is essential in the presence of a physically significant level shift that can produce secular divergences in the time-dependent perturbation functions. The normalization terms are always important, although the formulation of a simple method for including them is of greatest utility in applications requiring higher-order perturbation theory (e.g., nonlinear optical phenomena), where difficulties have arisen in previous treatments. Although the Dirac perturbation technique includes the correct secular and normalization terms when properly executed, it is convenient to reinterpret the perturbation problem so that the secular and normalization terms can be factored from the wave function to all orders. It is shown that an appropriate over-all multiplicative, time-dependent normalization and phase factor can be obtained, and that it is simply the amplitude for finding the system in the unperturbed eigenstate at any time t. The regular part of the wave function remaining after this factorization provides a complete description of the physical properties of the system of interest and determines the over-all normalization and phase, as well. Most important, the regular function and its perturbation expansion satisfy equations which are more convenient for computational applications than are the customary Dirac equations, and, in contrast to the latter, they reduce directly to the familiar time-independent perturbation equations in the static limit. To illustrate the general development, the model problem of a linearly perturbed harmonic oscillator and the static, harmonic, and electromagnetic perturbations of arbitrary quantum-mechanical systems are treated explicitly. In the case of an adiabatically applied static perturbation, the familiar adiabatic theorem is recovered with the over-all phase factor giving the perturbed eigenvalue, while in the case of an harmonic perturbation, the overall phase factor obtained includes the system level shift appropriate for a quasiperiodic state. For an electromagnetic perturbation, compact expressions are obtained for various nonlinear optical susceptibilities in forms suitable for computations. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximations are treated explicity to demonstrate that difficulties can arise when normalization and secular terms are not extracted prior to application of the perturbation formalism. Connection is also made with other methods which can be employed to eliminate secular and normalization terms from the wave function; these include a projection procedure and multiple-time-scales perturbation theory. The elimination of secular divergences from the perturbation functions is shown to be important for the construction of a valid Fourier transform. Secular and normalization terms also arise in connection with variational principles for the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. By employing the Frenkel variational principle and an ansatz for the total wave function that explicitly isolates the secular and normalization terms, a computationally convenient variational functional is obtained. This form of the Frenkel principle provides a bound to the system level shift induced by an oscillatory perturbation and is equivalent to the Ritz variational principle in the static limit. Explicit expressions for the variational functional in the Hartree-Fock approximations are derived in forms suitable for computational applications to the interactions of radiation and matter.},

abstract = {An alternative derivation of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) has been given, where a coupled cluster parametrization is used for the wave function and the method of undetermined Lagrange multipliers is applied to set up a variational coupled cluster energy expression. In this variational formulation, the nth-order amplitudes determine the energy to order 2n+1 and the nth-order multipliers determine the energy to order 2n+2. We have developed an iterative approximate coupled cluster singles, doubles, and triples model CC3, where the triples amplitudes are correct through second order and the singles amplitudes are treated without approximations due to the unique role of singles as approximate orbital relaxation parameters. The compact energy expressions obtained from the variational formulation exhibit in a simple way the relationship between CC3, CCSDT-1a [Lee et al., J. Chem. Phys. 81, 5906 (1984)] CCSDT-1b models [Urban et al., J. Chem. Phys. 83, 4041 (1985)], and the CCSD(T) model [Raghavachari et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 157, 479 (1989)]. Sample calculations of total energies are presented for the molecules H2O, C2, CO, and C2H4. Comparisons are made with full CCSDT, CCSDT-1a, CCSDT-1b, CCSD(T), and full configuration interaction (FCI) results. These calculations demonstrate that CC3 and CCSD(T) give total energies of a similar quality. If results obtained by CC3 and CCSD(T) differ significantly, neither method can be trusted. In contrast to CCSD(T), time-dependent response functions can be obtained for CC3. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {High harmonic generation (HHG) provides a flexible framework for the development of coherent light sources in the extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray regimes. However it suffers from low conversion efficiencies as the control of the HHG spectral and temporal characteristics requires manipulating electron trajectories on attosecond time scale. The phase matching mechanism has been employed to selectively enhance specific quantum paths leading to HHG. A few important fundamental questions remain open, among those how much of the enhancement can be achieved by the single-emitter and what is the role of correlations (or the electronic structure) in the selectivity and control of HHG generation. Here we address those questions by examining computationally the possibility of optimizing the HHG spectrum of isolated hydrogen and helium atoms by shaping the slowly varying envelope of a 800 nm, 200-cycles long laser pulse. The spectra are computed with a fully quantum mechanical description, by explicitly computing the time-dependent dipole moment of the systems using a time-dependent density-functional approach (or the single-electron Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation for the case of H), on top of a one-dimensional model. The sought optimization corresponds to the selective enhancement of single harmonics, which we find to be significant. This selectivity is entirely due to the single atom response, and not to any propagation or phase-matching effect. Moreover, we see that the electronic correlation plays a role in the determining the degree of optimization that can be obtained.},

It has also been used to study molecular conductance, excited state dynamics, ionization, and nonlinear optical effects. Real-time techniques describe non-perturbative responses of molecules, allowing for studies that go above and beyond the more traditional energy- or frequency-domain-based response theories. Recent progress in signal analysis, accurate treatment of environmental responses, relativistic Hamiltonians, and even quantized electromagnetic fields have opened up new avenues of research in time-dependent molecular response. After discussing the history of real-time methods, we explore some of the necessary mathematical theory behind the methods, and then survey a wide (yet incomplete) variety of applications for real-time methods.

The implementation is first validated against linear-response TDDFT and experimental results for a series of molecules subjected to small electric field perturbations.

Using modern techniques borrowed from analytical derivative methods, we were able to improve the efficiency of the GIAO method significantly. Results with several basis sets, some of them large, are presented for methane, methyl fluoride, cyclopropene, cyclopropane, oxirane, benzene, carbon disulfide, the sulfate and thiosulfate anions, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethyl sulfone. Computer timings for energy and chemical shielding calculations are given for a few large organic molecules. Comparisons are made with the individual gauge for localized orbitals (IGLO) method of Schindler and Kutzelnigg, and with the localized orbital/local origin (LORG) method of Hansen and Bouman. The GIAO method appears to converge faster than the localized techniques; i.e., it provides the same accuracy with a smaller basis, particularly for the individual tensor components. The computational effort for the ab initio calculation of the NMR chemical shifts is only {\~{}}2.5 times of the energy calculation. {\textcopyright} 1990, American Chemical Society.

We determine the coupled cluster ground states by imaginary time propagation for these molecules. Excited state energies are obtained from the Fourier transform of the time-dependent dipole moment after an ultrashort, broadband laser excitation. The time-dependent expectation values are calculated from the complex cluster amplitudes using the corresponding configuration interaction singles doubles wave functions.

annote = {interestingly, it seems like Klamroth totally abandoned TD-CC after this paper, in favor of his existing TD-CI architecture.

Fun paper. weird TD-CC formalism in which they compute the dipole by reconstructing the matrix element using CISD. regardless, they do 3 major tests: 

1) imaginary time propagation. they show that, starting from T1 = T2 = 0 (the HF reference), they can converge the CCSD ground state equations via imaginary time propagation.

2) dipole trajectory and spectrum. they show that calculating the explicitly time-dependent dipole (which shows the expected symmetry) yields the appropriate excitation frequencies (compared to the EOM) when Fourier transformed into the frequency domain. 

3) small differences between the results of 2) and the EOM excitation energies are thought to be due to nonlinear effects. to test this, field pulses which are narrow in the frequency domain are used to selectively excite just two excited states of NH3. These excitation energies proved to be identical to those shown by 2), which suggests the errors in 2) are not due to nonlinear effects, but perhaps instead due to numerical instabilities of the wfn in the high-energy field or long-time propagation regimes. they propose to fix this with Brueckner orbitals. 

Is there a follow-up paper to this?},

abstract = {We show that whenever an electron transfers between closed-shell molecular fragments, the exact correlation potential of time-dependent density functional theory develops a step and peak structure in the bonding region. This structure has a density dependence that is nonlocal both in space and in time that even the exact adiabatic ground-state exchange-correlation functional fails to capture it. For charge-transfer between open-shell fragments, an initial step and peak vanish as the charge-transfer state is reached. The inability of usual approximations to develop these structures leads to inaccurate charge-transfer dynamics. This is illustrated by the complete lack of Rabi oscillations in the dipole moment under conditions of resonant charge transfer for an exactly solvable model system. The results transcend the model and are applicable to more realistic molecular complexes. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Specific rotation calculations carried out at the density functional theory (DFT) level for model chiral methane molecule, fluorooxirane, methyloxirane, and dimethylmethylenecyclopropane reveal that the ORP set outperforms larger basis sets, among them the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set of Dunning (J.

It is shown to be an attractive choice also in the case of larger systems, namely norbornanone, $\beta$-pinene, trans-pinane, and nopinone. The ORP basis set is further used in OR calculations for 24 other systems, and the results are compared to the aug-cc-pVDZ values. Whenever large discrepancies of results are observed, the ORP values are in an excellent agreement with the aug-cc-pVTZ results. The ORP basis set enables accurate specific rotation calculations at a reduced cost and thus can be recommended for routine DFT OR calculations, also for large and conformationally flexible molecules. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {A new intrinsic localization algorithm is suggested based on a recently developed mathematical measure of localization. No external criteria are used to define a priori bonds, lone pairs, and core orbitals. It is shown that the method similarly to Edmiston-Ruedenberg's localization prefers the well established chemical concept of $\sigma$-$\pi$ separation, while on the other hand, works as economically as Boys' procedure. For the application of the new localization algorithm, no additional quantities are to be calculated, the knowledge of atomic overlap intergrals is sufficient. This feature allows a unique formulation of the theory, adaptable for both ab initio and semiempirical methods, even in those cases where the exact form of the atomic basis functions is not defined (like in the EHT and PPP calculations). The implementation of the procedure in already existing program systems is particularly easy. For illustrative examples, we compare the Edmiston-Ruedenberg and Boys localized orbitals with those calculated by the method suggested here, within both the CNDO/2 and ab initio frameworks (using STO-3G and 6-31G** basis sets) for several molecules (CO, H2CO, B2H6, and N2O4).

We find that incorporating a fixed number of orbitals from the pair natural orbital (PNO) space into the PNO++ method - a new method presented here, the "combined PNO++"approach - recovers accuracy in the CCSD correlation energy while preserving the well-behaved convergence behavior of the PNO++ method for linear response properties.},

abstract = {One of the challenges of interpreting electronic circular dichroism (ECD) band spectra is that different states may have different rotatory strength signs, determined by their absolute configuration. If the states are closely spaced and opposite in sign, observed transitions may be washed out by nearby states, unlike absorption spectra where transitions are always positive additive. To accurately compute ECD bands, it is necessary to compute a large number of excited states, which may be prohibitively costly if one uses the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) framework. Here we implement a real-time, atomic-orbital based TDDFT method for computing the entire ECD spectrum simultaneously. The method is advantageous for large systems with a high density of states. In contrast to previous implementations based on real-space grids, the method is variational, independent of nuclear orientation, and does not rely on pseudopotential approximations, making it suitable for computation of chiroptical properties well into the X-ray regime.},

abstract = {Following the recent studies of basis sets explicitly dependent on oscillatory external electric field we have investigated the possibility of some further truncation of the so-called polarized basis sets without any major deterioration of the computed data for molecular dipole moments, dipole polarizabilities, and related electric properties of molecules. It has been found that basis sets of contracted Gaussian functions of the form [3s1p] for H and [4s3p1d] for the first-row atoms can satisfy this requirement with particular choice of contractions in their polarization part. With m denoting the number of primitive GTOs in the contracted polarization function, the basis sets devised in this article will be referred to as the ZmPol sets. In comparison with earlier, medium-size polarized basis sets (PolX), these new ZmPol basis sets are reduced by 2/3 in their size and lead to the order of magnitude computing time savings for large molecules. Simultaneously, the dipole moment and polarizability data remain at almost the same level of accuracy as in the case of the PolX sets. Among a variety of possible applications in computational chemistry, the ZmPolX are also to be used for calculations of frequencies and intensities in the Raman spectra of large organic molecules (see Part II, this issue). {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Peach2008,
abstract = {Electronic excitation energies are determined using the CAM-B3LYP Coulomb-attenuated functional [T. Yanai et al. Chem. Phys. Lett. 393, 51 (2004)], together with a standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and hybrid functional. The degree of spatial overlap between the occupied and virtual orbitals involved in an excitation is measured using a quantity Lambda, and the extent to which excitation energy errors correlate with Lambda is quantified. For a set of 59 excitations of local, Rydberg, and intramolecular charge-transfer character in 18 theoretically challenging main-group molecules, CAM-B3LYP provides by far the best overall performance; no correlation is observed between excitation energy errors and Lambda, reflecting the good quality, balanced description of all three categories of excitation. By contrast, a clear correlation is observed for the GGA and, to a lesser extent, the hybrid functional, allowing a simple diagnostic test to be proposed for judging the reliability of a general excitation from these functionals--when Lambda falls below a prescribed threshold, excitations are likely to be in very significant error. The study highlights the ambiguous nature of the term "charge transfer," providing insight into the observation that while many charge-transfer excitations are poorly described by GGA and hybrid functionals, others are accurately reproduced.},

abstract = {The first full implementation of the localized configuration interaction technique at the variational CI, CEPA-2 and variational CEPA levels is described. Timings are presented for a double-zeta plus polarization calculation on butadiene. The restriction of the correlation space to local basis functions results in a spectacular enhancement of the efficiency of the CI loop. The loss in the correlation energy is only a few percent; we argue that most of the loss is due to the exclusion of intramolecular basis set superposition artifacts. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

@article{Nascimento2017,
abstract = {An explicitly time-dependent (TD) approach to equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) is implemented for simulating near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure in molecular systems. The TD-EOM-CCSD absorption line shape function is given by the Fourier transform of the CCSD dipole autocorrelation function. We represent this transform by its Pad{\'{e}} approximant, which provides converged spectra in much shorter simulation times than are required by the Fourier form. The result is a powerful framework for the blackbox simulation of broadband absorption spectra. K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in several small molecules are obtained from the real part of the absorption line shape function and are compared with experiment. The computed and experimentally obtained spectra are in good agreement; the mean unsigned error in the predicted peak positions is only 1.2 eV. We also explore the spectral signatures of protonation in these molecules.},

@article{Kristiansen2020,
abstract = {We investigate the numerical stability of time-dependent coupled-cluster theory for many-electron dynamics in intense laser pulses, comparing two coupled-cluster formulations with full configuration interaction theory. Our numerical experiments show that orbital-adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster doubles (OATDCCD) theory offers significantly improved stability compared with the conventional Hartree-Fock-based time-dependent coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles (TDCCSD) formulation. The improved stability stems from greatly reduced oscillations in the doubles amplitudes, which, in turn, can be traced to the dynamic biorthonormal reference determinants of OATDCCD theory. As long as these are good approximations to the Brueckner determinant, OATDCCD theory is numerically stable. We propose the reference weight as a diagnostic quantity to identify situations where the TDCCSD and OATDCCD theories become unstable.},

@article{Yabana1999,
abstract = {The time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA) is applied to the optical response of conjugated carbon molecules in the energy range of 0-30 eV, with calculations given for carbon chains, polyenes, retinal, benzene, and C60. The major feature of the spectra, the collective $\pi$-$\pi$* transition, is seen at energies ranging from below 2 to 7 eV and is reproduced by the theory to a few tenths of an electron volt with a good account of systematic trends. However, there is some indication that TDLDA predicts too much fragmentation of the strength function in large molecules. Transition strengths are reproduced with a typical accuracy of 20{\%}. The theory also predicts a broad absorption peak in the range of 15-25 eV, and this feature agrees with experiment in the one case where quantitative data is available (benzene). {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.
