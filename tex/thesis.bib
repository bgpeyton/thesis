abstract = {Summary Second quantization formalism is introduced for an efficient description of molecular electronic systems in the nonrelativistic limit and an explicit description of electron spin. Spin orbitals are functions of three continuous spatial coordinates and one discrete spin coordinate. Quantum-mechanical operators may be classified according to how they affect the orbital and spin parts of wave functions. The operators are spin-free or spinless operator, pure spin operator and mixed operator. The author adopts the theory of spin tensor operators for angular momentum in quantum mechanics and develops a useful set of tools for the construction and classification of states and operators with definite spin symmetry properties. Singlet excitation operators play an important role in the second-quantization treatment of molecular electronic structure. This chapter shows how a basis of spin eigenfunctions can set up by taking linear combinations of Slater determinants.},

@article{Norman2011,
abstract = {The development of electronic response theory in quantum chemistry has been reviewed, starting from the early 1970's and reaching the current state-of-the-art. The general theory has been applied to the calculation of a large number of spectroscopic parameters over the years, and it has been implemented for the majority of standard electronic structure methods. Two formulations of response theory, the Ehrenfest expectation value and the quasi-energy derivative formulation, have turned into leading alternatives for the derivation of computationally tractable expressions of response functions, and they are here reviewed with an attempt to, as far as possible, leave out technical details. A set of four steps are identified as common in derivations of response functions, and the two formulations are compared along this series of steps. Particular emphasis is given to the situation when the oscillation of the weak external electromagnetic field is in resonance with a transition frequency of the system. The formation of physically sound response functions in resonance regions of the spectrum is discussed in light of the causality condition and the Kramers-Kronig relations, and it is achieved in wave function theory by means of the introduction of relaxation parameters in a manner that mimics what one sees in density matrix theory. As a working example, equations are illustrated by their application to a two-state model for para-nitroaniline including the ground and the lowest charge-transfer state in the electric dipole approximation.},

@article{Christiansen1998,
abstract = {It is demonstrated that frequency-dependent response functions can conveniently be derived from the time-averaged quasienergy. The variational criteria for the quasienergy determines the time-evolution of the wave-function parameters and the time-averaged time-dependent Hellmann-Feynman theorem allows an identification of response functions as derivatives of the quasienergy. The quasienergy therefore plays the same role as the usual energy in time-independent theory, and the same techniques can be used to obtain computationally tractable expressions for response properties, as for energy derivatives in time-independent theory. This includes the use of the variational Lagrangian technique for obtaining expressions for molecular properties in accord with the 2n+1 and 2n+2 rules. The derivation of frequency-dependent response properties becomes a simple extension of variational perturbation theory to a Fourier component variational perturbation theory. The generality and simplicity of this approach are illustrated by derivation of linear and higher-order response functions for both exact and approximate wave functions and for both variational and nonvariational wave functions. Examples of approximate models discussed in this article are coupled-cluster, self-consistent field, and second-order M�ller-Plesset perturbation theory. A discussion of symmetry properties of the response functions and their relation to molecular properties is also given, with special attention to the calculation of transition- and excited-state properties.���� 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

abstract = {Developments in computational molecular electronic structure theory are discussed, emphasizing on molecular response theory based on construction of a many-electron wave function. To establish a variation principle for the quasi-energy in the intermediate normalization, the quasi-energy is calculated subject to the constraint that the intermediately normalized state satisfies the projected Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. The equations of motion for the response functions is used to obtain relations between transition-matrix elements. The studies have also found that eigenvalues are not encountered for electronic systems dominated by a single determinant and may always be removed by extending the excitation manifold. In the formulation by Olsen and J{\o}rgensen, response functions are obtained by applying the Ehrenfest theorem to determine the time evolution of an expectation value for the Hartree-Fock and multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) states.},

Based on the expansion of this expectation value in orders of the generally time-dependent perturbation, we subsequently identify the coupled cluster time-independent expectation value, the linear response function, and the quadratic response function. The response functions and their residues behave physically correctly. Spectroscopic observables are identified as residues, whereas the identification of individual transition matrix elements is prohibited. Thus the unphysical behavior of previously published coupled cluster response functions may be viewed not as a consequence of the projection, but rather that identifications are made on the basis of an unphysical expectation value or quasienergy.},

The successes of local-coupled-cluster and related approaches are well known for reaction energies, thermodynamic constants, dipole moments, and so forth—properties that depend primarily on the quality of the ground-state wave function. However, much more challenging are higher-order properties such as polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, optical rotations, magnetizabilities, and others that also require accurate representation of the derivative of the wave function to external electromagnetic fields. We discuss a range of methods for improving the correlation domains of such perturbed wave functions, including the use of “perturbation-aware” natural orbitals that are customized for the property of interest. In addition, we consider the viability and potential of promising, but still-emerging methods such as stochastic and real-time coupled-cluster approaches, for which the localizability of the field-dependent wave function may be more controllable than for conventional response theory.

Since its first modern use in the 1990s, it has been used to study a wide variety of spectroscopic properties and electronic responses to intense external electromagnetic fields, complex environments, and open quantum systems. It has also been used to study molecular conductance, excited state dynamics, ionization, and nonlinear optical effects. Real-time techniques describe non-perturbative responses of molecules, allowing for studies that go above and beyond the more traditional energy- or frequency-domain-based response theories. Recent progress in signal analysis, accurate treatment of environmental responses, relativistic Hamiltonians, and even quantized electromagnetic fields have opened up new avenues of research in time-dependent molecular response. After discussing the history of real-time methods, we explore some of the necessary mathematical theory behind the methods, and then survey a wide (yet incomplete) variety of applications for real-time methods.

abstract = {The Dirac variation-of-constants method has long provided a basis for perturbative solution of the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. In spite of its widespread utilization, certain aspects of the method have been discussed only superficially and remain somewhat obscure. The present review attempts to clarify some of these points, particularly those related to secular and normalization terms. Secular terms arise from an over-all time-dependent phase in the wave function, while normalization terms preserve the norm of the wave function. A proper treatment of the secular terms is essential in the presence of a physically significant level shift that can produce secular divergences in the time-dependent perturbation functions. The normalization terms are always important, although the formulation of a simple method for including them is of greatest utility in applications requiring higher-order perturbation theory (e.g., nonlinear optical phenomena), where difficulties have arisen in previous treatments. Although the Dirac perturbation technique includes the correct secular and normalization terms when properly executed, it is convenient to reinterpret the perturbation problem so that the secular and normalization terms can be factored from the wave function to all orders. It is shown that an appropriate over-all multiplicative, time-dependent normalization and phase factor can be obtained, and that it is simply the amplitude for finding the system in the unperturbed eigenstate at any time t. The regular part of the wave function remaining after this factorization provides a complete description of the physical properties of the system of interest and determines the over-all normalization and phase, as well. Most important, the regular function and its perturbation expansion satisfy equations which are more convenient for computational applications than are the customary Dirac equations, and, in contrast to the latter, they reduce directly to the familiar time-independent perturbation equations in the static limit. To illustrate the general development, the model problem of a linearly perturbed harmonic oscillator and the static, harmonic, and electromagnetic perturbations of arbitrary quantum-mechanical systems are treated explicitly. In the case of an adiabatically applied static perturbation, the familiar adiabatic theorem is recovered with the over-all phase factor giving the perturbed eigenvalue, while in the case of an harmonic perturbation, the overall phase factor obtained includes the system level shift appropriate for a quasiperiodic state. For an electromagnetic perturbation, compact expressions are obtained for various nonlinear optical susceptibilities in forms suitable for computations. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximations are treated explicity to demonstrate that difficulties can arise when normalization and secular terms are not extracted prior to application of the perturbation formalism. Connection is also made with other methods which can be employed to eliminate secular and normalization terms from the wave function; these include a projection procedure and multiple-time-scales perturbation theory. The elimination of secular divergences from the perturbation functions is shown to be important for the construction of a valid Fourier transform. Secular and normalization terms also arise in connection with variational principles for the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. By employing the Frenkel variational principle and an ansatz for the total wave function that explicitly isolates the secular and normalization terms, a computationally convenient variational functional is obtained. This form of the Frenkel principle provides a bound to the system level shift induced by an oscillatory perturbation and is equivalent to the Ritz variational principle in the static limit. Explicit expressions for the variational functional in the Hartree-Fock approximations are derived in forms suitable for computational applications to the interactions of radiation and matter.},
