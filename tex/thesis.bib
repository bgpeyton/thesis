abstract = {Real-time time-dependent electronic structure theory is one of the most promising methods for investigating time-dependent molecular responses and electronic dynamics. Since its first modern use in the 1990s, it has been used to study a wide variety of spectroscopic properties and electronic responses to intense external electromagnetic fields, complex environments, and open quantum systems. It has also been used to study molecular conductance, excited state dynamics, ionization, and nonlinear optical effects. Real-time techniques describe non-perturbative responses of molecules, allowing for studies that go above and beyond the more traditional energy- or frequency-domain-based response theories. Recent progress in signal analysis, accurate treatment of environmental responses, relativistic Hamiltonians, and even quantized electromagnetic fields have opened up new avenues of research in time-dependent molecular response. After discussing the history of real-time methods, we explore some of the necessary mathematical theory behind the methods, and then survey a wide (yet incomplete) variety of applications for real-time methods. We then present some brief remarks on the future of real-time time-dependent electronic structure theory. WIREs Comput Mol Sci 2018, 8:e1341. doi: 10.1002/wcms.1341.

abstract = {We review the current state of reduced-scaling electron correlation methods, particularly coupled-cluster theory for the simulation and prediction of molecular response properties. The successes of local-coupled-cluster and related approaches are well known for reaction energies, thermodynamic constants, dipole moments, and so forth—properties that depend primarily on the quality of the ground-state wave function. However, much more challenging are higher-order properties such as polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, optical rotations, magnetizabilities, and others that also require accurate representation of the derivative of the wave function to external electromagnetic fields. We discuss a range of methods for improving the correlation domains of such perturbed wave functions, including the use of “perturbation-aware” natural orbitals that are customized for the property of interest. In addition, we consider the viability and potential of promising, but still-emerging methods such as stochastic and real-time coupled-cluster approaches, for which the localizability of the field-dependent wave function may be more controllable than for conventional response theory.

abstract = {An alternative derivation of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) has been given, where a coupled cluster parametrization is used for the wave function and the method of undetermined Lagrange multipliers is applied to set up a variational coupled cluster energy expression. In this variational formulation, the nth-order amplitudes determine the energy to order 2n+1 and the nth-order multipliers determine the energy to order 2n+2. We have developed an iterative approximate coupled cluster singles, doubles, and triples model CC3, where the triples amplitudes are correct through second order and the singles amplitudes are treated without approximations due to the unique role of singles as approximate orbital relaxation parameters. The compact energy expressions obtained from the variational formulation exhibit in a simple way the relationship between CC3, CCSDT-1a [Lee et al., J. Chem. Phys. 81, 5906 (1984)] CCSDT-1b models [Urban et al., J. Chem. Phys. 83, 4041 (1985)], and the CCSD(T) model [Raghavachari et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 157, 479 (1989)]. Sample calculations of total energies are presented for the molecules H2O, C2, CO, and C2H4. Comparisons are made with full CCSDT, CCSDT-1a, CCSDT-1b, CCSD(T), and full configuration interaction (FCI) results. These calculations demonstrate that CC3 and CCSD(T) give total energies of a similar quality. If results obtained by CC3 and CCSD(T) differ significantly, neither method can be trusted. In contrast to CCSD(T), time-dependent response functions can be obtained for CC3. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that laser-driven many-electron dynamics, as described by bivariational time-dependent coupled-cluster (CC) theory, may be analyzed in terms of stationary-state populations. Projectors heuristically defined from linear response theory and equation-of-motion CC theory are proposed for the calculation of stationary-state populations during interaction with laser pulses or other external forces, and conservation laws of the populations are discussed. Numerical tests of the proposed projectors, involving both linear and nonlinear optical processes for He and Be atoms and for LiH, CH+, and LiF molecules show that the laser-driven evolution of the stationary-state populations at the coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles (CCSD) level is very close to that obtained by full configuration interaction (FCI) theory, provided that all stationary states actively participating in the dynamics are sufficiently well approximated. When double-excited states are important for the dynamics, the quality of the CCSD results deteriorates. Observing that populations computed from the linear response projector may show spurious small-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations, the equation-of-motion projector emerges as the most promising approach to stationary-state populations.},

Comparison between coupled cluster linear response theory and experimental data (both gas and liquid phase) yields encouraging results for small to medium-sized chiral molecules including rigid species such as (S)-2-chloropropionitrile and (P)-[4]triangulane, as well as conformationally flexible molecules such as (R)-epichlorohydrin. More problematic comparisons are offered by (S)-methyloxirane, (S)-methylthiirane, and (1S,4S)-norbornenone, for which the comparison between theory and experiment is much poorer. The impact of basis-set incompleteness, electron correlation, zero-point vibration, and temperature are discussed. In addition, future prospects and obstacles for the development of efficient and reliable quantum chemical models of optical activity are discussed, including the problem of gauge invariance, scaling of the coupled cluster approach with system size, and solvation.},

abstract = {We introduce an inherently real coupled cluster time-dependent expectation value of a Hermitian operator. Based on the expansion of this expectation value in orders of the generally time-dependent perturbation, we subsequently identify the coupled cluster time-independent expectation value, the linear response function, and the quadratic response function. The response functions and their residues behave physically correctly. Spectroscopic observables are identified as residues, whereas the identification of individual transition matrix elements is prohibited. Thus the unphysical behavior of previously published coupled cluster response functions may be viewed not as a consequence of the projection, but rather that identifications are made on the basis of an unphysical expectation value or quasienergy.},

It was necessary to use a very large number of excited states in order to achieve convergence with the results of the more direct linear response method. However, the latter does not give information on which excited states are important in determining the specific rotation. Norbornenone is unique in that its greatly enhanced specific rotation as compared to norbornanone is associated with the low-energy n-$\pi$* transition.

abstract = {The development of electronic response theory in quantum chemistry has been reviewed, starting from the early 1970's and reaching the current state-of-the-art. The general theory has been applied to the calculation of a large number of spectroscopic parameters over the years, and it has been implemented for the majority of standard electronic structure methods. Two formulations of response theory, the Ehrenfest expectation value and the quasi-energy derivative formulation, have turned into leading alternatives for the derivation of computationally tractable expressions of response functions, and they are here reviewed with an attempt to, as far as possible, leave out technical details. A set of four steps are identified as common in derivations of response functions, and the two formulations are compared along this series of steps. Particular emphasis is given to the situation when the oscillation of the weak external electromagnetic field is in resonance with a transition frequency of the system. The formation of physically sound response functions in resonance regions of the spectrum is discussed in light of the causality condition and the Kramers-Kronig relations, and it is achieved in wave function theory by means of the introduction of relaxation parameters in a manner that mimics what one sees in density matrix theory. As a working example, equations are illustrated by their application to a two-state model for para-nitroaniline including the ground and the lowest charge-transfer state in the electric dipole approximation.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary The correlation problem has been a focal point of quantum chemistry for more than 40 years. Coupled-cluster methods typically offer its best numerical solution for molecules and atoms in terms of rigor and systematic convergence to the right answer. Coupled-cluster (CC) theory is not variational, but, more importantly, it is size-extensive making energy differences meaningful and applications to extended systems like polymers and solids possible. CC introduces higher excitations much more effectively and at less expense than analogous configuration interaction methods. As a nonvariational method, analytical gradients in CC theory require new developments compared to other methods. These new developments emphasize the role of the CC functional that underlies the CC theory for energies, forces, density matrices, and properties of ground and equation-of-motion (EOM-CC) excited states. The latter also permits facile applications for single, doubly, etc. ionized and electron-attached states. The evolution of the critical ideas that lead to coupled-cluster theory and its extensive applications in chemistry are enumerated, in an objective, but personal, first-hand account.},

The equations of motion for the response functions is used to obtain relations between transition-matrix elements. The studies have also found that eigenvalues are not encountered for electronic systems dominated by a single determinant and may always be removed by extending the excitation manifold. In the formulation by Olsen and J{\o}rgensen, response functions are obtained by applying the Ehrenfest theorem to determine the time evolution of an expectation value for the Hartree-Fock and multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) states.},

Spin orbitals are functions of three continuous spatial coordinates and one discrete spin coordinate. Quantum-mechanical operators may be classified according to how they affect the orbital and spin parts of wave functions. The operators are spin-free or spinless operator, pure spin operator and mixed operator. The author adopts the theory of spin tensor operators for angular momentum in quantum mechanics and develops a useful set of tools for the construction and classification of states and operators with definite spin symmetry properties. Singlet excitation operators play an important role in the second-quantization treatment of molecular electronic structure. This chapter shows how a basis of spin eigenfunctions can set up by taking linear combinations of Slater determinants.},

abstract = {It is demonstrated that frequency-dependent response functions can conveniently be derived from the time-averaged quasienergy. The variational criteria for the quasienergy determines the time-evolution of the wave-function parameters and the time-averaged time-dependent Hellmann-Feynman theorem allows an identification of response functions as derivatives of the quasienergy. The quasienergy therefore plays the same role as the usual energy in time-independent theory, and the same techniques can be used to obtain computationally tractable expressions for response properties, as for energy derivatives in time-independent theory. This includes the use of the variational Lagrangian technique for obtaining expressions for molecular properties in accord with the 2n+1 and 2n+2 rules. The derivation of frequency-dependent response properties becomes a simple extension of variational perturbation theory to a Fourier component variational perturbation theory. The generality and simplicity of this approach are illustrated by derivation of linear and higher-order response functions for both exact and approximate wave functions and for both variational and nonvariational wave functions. Examples of approximate models discussed in this article are coupled-cluster, self-consistent field, and second-order M�ller-Plesset perturbation theory. A discussion of symmetry properties of the response functions and their relation to molecular properties is also given, with special attention to the calculation of transition- and excited-state properties.���� 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

@article{Langhoff,
abstract = {The Dirac variation-of-constants method has long provided a basis for perturbative solution of the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. In spite of its widespread utilization, certain aspects of the method have been discussed only superficially and remain somewhat obscure. The present review attempts to clarify some of these points, particularly those related to secular and normalization terms. Secular terms arise from an over-all time-dependent phase in the wave function, while normalization terms preserve the norm of the wave function. A proper treatment of the secular terms is essential in the presence of a physically significant level shift that can produce secular divergences in the time-dependent perturbation functions. The normalization terms are always important, although the formulation of a simple method for including them is of greatest utility in applications requiring higher-order perturbation theory (e.g., nonlinear optical phenomena), where difficulties have arisen in previous treatments. Although the Dirac perturbation technique includes the correct secular and normalization terms when properly executed, it is convenient to reinterpret the perturbation problem so that the secular and normalization terms can be factored from the wave function to all orders. It is shown that an appropriate over-all multiplicative, time-dependent normalization and phase factor can be obtained, and that it is simply the amplitude for finding the system in the unperturbed eigenstate at any time t. The regular part of the wave function remaining after this factorization provides a complete description of the physical properties of the system of interest and determines the over-all normalization and phase, as well. Most important, the regular function and its perturbation expansion satisfy equations which are more convenient for computational applications than are the customary Dirac equations, and, in contrast to the latter, they reduce directly to the familiar time-independent perturbation equations in the static limit. To illustrate the general development, the model problem of a linearly perturbed harmonic oscillator and the static, harmonic, and electromagnetic perturbations of arbitrary quantum-mechanical systems are treated explicitly. In the case of an adiabatically applied static perturbation, the familiar adiabatic theorem is recovered with the over-all phase factor giving the perturbed eigenvalue, while in the case of an harmonic perturbation, the overall phase factor obtained includes the system level shift appropriate for a quasiperiodic state. For an electromagnetic perturbation, compact expressions are obtained for various nonlinear optical susceptibilities in forms suitable for computations. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximations are treated explicity to demonstrate that difficulties can arise when normalization and secular terms are not extracted prior to application of the perturbation formalism. Connection is also made with other methods which can be employed to eliminate secular and normalization terms from the wave function; these include a projection procedure and multiple-time-scales perturbation theory. The elimination of secular divergences from the perturbation functions is shown to be important for the construction of a valid Fourier transform. Secular and normalization terms also arise in connection with variational principles for the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. By employing the Frenkel variational principle and an ansatz for the total wave function that explicitly isolates the secular and normalization terms, a computationally convenient variational functional is obtained. This form of the Frenkel principle provides a bound to the system level shift induced by an oscillatory perturbation and is equivalent to the Ritz variational principle in the static limit. Explicit expressions for the variational functional in the Hartree-Fock approximations are derived in forms suitable for computational applications to the interactions of radiation and matter.},
