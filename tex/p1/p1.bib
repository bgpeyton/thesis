abstract = {A multicentered integrated QM/QM technique has been developed. By separating high-level calculations in distinct regions of molecules, the multicentered approach supplants a single large high-level calculation with several smaller calculations. Due to the steep polynomial scaling of traditional ab initio quantum chemical methods, this separation significantly enhances the computational efficiency of QM/QM methods. The straightforward implementation of this multicentered approach is illustrated with several large poly-alcohols that form hydrogen bonds with water. The largest alcohol-water complex contains 81 atoms. For properly selected model systems, this multicentered approach introduces essentially no error in the dissociation energies of these complexes relative to conventional QM/QM schemes. This multicentered technique should be easily extended to other, more general integrated methods (QM/MM, ONIOM, etc).},

It is argued that from the physical point of view the “hierarchical” scheme of Valiron and Mayer should be preferred and not the scheme recently discussed by Ouyang and Bettens, because it permits the energy of the individual monomers and all the two-body, three-body, etc. energy components to be free of unphysical dependence on the arrangement (basis functions) of other subsystems in the cluster.},

abstract = {A detailed analysis of the interaction-induced linear and non-linear axial static electric dipole properties and the interaction energy of the model HCHO(HF)(n) (n = 1, 2) complexes is carried out using the HF SCF, MP2, CCSD and CCSD(T) levels of approximation combined with a wide range of basis sets, namely the correlation-consistent basis sets of Dunning and co-workers, the polarization-consistent basis sets of Jensen, and the recently reported polarized LPol sets. The results of this study show that even the smallest among the LPol sets, the LPol-ds and LPol-dl sets, yield interaction induced axial static electric dipole properties of an accuracy comparable to that obtained with the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set. Using the LPol-ds, the LPol-dl, and the LPol-fl sets we have estimated the induced electric properties and the interaction energy of the HCHO(HF)(n) (n = 1-9) complexes, the cooperative effects in these systems, and the two-body effects. The many-body analysis shows that the two-body contributions to the induced first hyperpolarizability are not sufficient to correctly reproduce the general tendency for the changes in the property with the elongation of the polymer chain, since already for the n = 4 complex the more-than-two-body terms become dominant.},

The hydrogen-bonded model chains consisting of HF, H(2)CO and H(3)N molecules have been chosen as a case study. The calculations of the components of the static electric properties using the diffuse Dunning's basis set (aug-cc-pVDZ) have been performed employing different types of density functionals (B3LYP, LC-BLYP, PBE0, M06-2X and CAM-B3LYP). Obtained results have been compared with those gained at the CCSD(T) level of theory. The counterpoise correction scheme, namely site-site function counterpoise, has been applied in order to eliminate basis set superposition error. The performed tests allow to conclude that the DFT functionals can provide a useful tool for prediction of the interaction-induced electric properties, however a caution has to be urged to their decomposition to the two- and many-body terms.},

@article{Lao2016,
abstract = {To complement our study of the role of finite precision in electronic structure calculations based on a truncated many-body expansion (MBE, or “n-body expansion”), we examine the accuracy of such methods in the present work. Accuracy may be defined either with respect to a supersystem calculation computed at the same level of theory as the n-body calculations, or alternatively with respect to high-quality benchmarks. Both metrics are considered here. In applications to a sequence of water clusters, (H2O)N=6−55 described at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level, we obtain mean absolute errors (MAEs) per H2O monomer of ∼1.0 kcal/mol for two-body expansions, where the benchmark is a B3LYP/cc-pVDZ calculation on the entire cluster. Three- and four-body expansions exhibit MAEs of 0.5 and 0.1 kcal/mol/monomer, respectively, without resort to charge embedding. A generalized many-body expansion truncated at two-body terms [GMBE(2)], using 3–4 H2O molecules per frag- ment, outperforms all of these methods and affords a MAE of ∼0.02 kcal/mol/monomer, also without charge embedding. GMBE(2) requires significantly fewer (although somewhat larger) subsystem calculations as compared to MBE(4), reducing problems associated with floating-point roundoff errors. When compared to high-quality benchmarks, we find that error cancellation often plays a critical role in the success of MBE(n) calculations, even at the four-body level, as basis-set super- position error can compensate for higher-order polarization interactions. A many-body counterpoise correction is introduced for the GMBE, and its two-body truncation [GMBCP(2)] is found to afford good results without error cancellation. Together with a method such as $\omega$B97X-V/aug-cc-pVTZ that can describe both covalent and non-covalent interactions, the GMBE(2)+GMBCP(2) approach provides an accurate, stable, and tractable approach for large systems.},

Comparison between coupled cluster linear response theory and experimental data (both gas and liquid phase) yields encouraging results for small to medium-sized chiral molecules including rigid species such as (S)-2-chloropropionitrile and (P)-[4]triangulane, as well as conformationally flexible molecules such as (R)-epichlorohydrin. More problematic comparisons are offered by (S)-methyloxirane, (S)-methylthiirane, and (1S,4S)-norbornenone, for which the comparison between theory and experiment is much poorer. The impact of basis-set incompleteness, electron correlation, zero-point vibration, and temperature are discussed. In addition, future prospects and obstacles for the development of efficient and reliable quantum chemical models of optical activity are discussed, including the problem of gauge invariance, scaling of the coupled cluster approach with system size, and solvation.},

@article{McAlexander2016,
abstract = {We have investigated the performance of the reduced-scaling coupled cluster method based on projected atomic orbitals (PAOs), pair natural orbitals (PNOs), and orbital specific virtuals (OSVs) for the prediction of linear response properties. These methods introduce different degrees of controllable sparsity in the ground-state and perturbed coupled cluster wave functions, leading to localization errors in properties such as dynamic polarizabilities and specific optical rotations. Using a series of chiral test compounds, we find that the inherent costs associated with computing response properties are significantly greater than those for determining the ground-state energy. As the dimensionality of the molecular system increases-from (pseudo)linear structures, such as fluoroalkanes, to cagelike structures, such as $\beta$-pinene-the crossover point between canonical-orbital and localized-orbital algorithms increases substantially. Furthermore, both the OSV and PNO methods provide greater reduction in cost (as measured by the size of the double-excitation space) than do PAOs, and PNOs provide the greatest level of sparsity for the systems examined here. Single-excitation truncation induces much larger errors than corresponding doubles truncation due to the fact that the first-order contribution to the one-electron perturbed wave function appears in the singles amplitudes. Both the PNO and OSV methods perform reasonably well for frequency-dependent polarizabilities provided appropriate thresholds are used for the occupation-number and weak-pair cutoffs on which each method depends. Specific rotations, however, are very sensitive to wave function truncation, to the extent that aggressive thresholds can yield the incorrect sign of the rotation, due to the delicate balance of positive and negative wave function contributions to the mixed electric-/magnetic-field response.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of the optical rotation prediction (ORP) basis set for computing specific rotations at the coupled cluster (CC) level has been evaluated for a test set of 14 chiral compounds. For this purpose, the ORP basis set has been developed for the second-row atoms present in the investigated systems (that is, for sulfur, phosphorus, and chlorine). The quality of the resulting set was preliminarily evaluated for seven molecules using time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT). Rotations were calculated with the coupled cluster singles and doubles method (CCSD) as well as the second-order approximate coupled cluster singles and doubles method (CC2) with the correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets and extrapolated to estimate the complete basis-set (CBS) limit for comparison with the ORP basis set. In the compounds examined here, the ORP calculations on molecules containing only first-row atoms compare favorably with results from the larger aug-cc-pVTZ basis set, in some cases lying closer to the estimated CBS limit, while results for molecules containing second-row atoms indicate that larger correlation-consistent basis sets are necessary to obtain reliable estimates of the CBS limit.},

abstract = {The current state of locally correlated coupled cluster theory is reviewed, with an emphasis on recent developments applicable to response properties. The ``correlation domain'' selection schemes that have yielded great success for computations of ground-state energies are found to be inadequate for field-response properties, including polarizabilities, excitation energies, and transition probabilities. Alternative approaches for expanding the venerated Boughton---Pulay orbital domains are considered, including the use of the first-order orbital response via the coupled-perturbed Hartree---Fock equations. Applications of these selection schemes to frequency-dependent dipole-polarizabilities and optical rotation in chiral species demonstrate that local correlation methods have great promise for such properties for large molecules.},

abstract = {The frozen-virtual natural-orbital (NO) approach, whereby the unoccupied-orbital space is constructed using a correlated density such as that from many-body perturbation theory, has proven to yield compact wave functions for determining ground-state correlation energies and associated properties, with corresponding occupation numbers providing a guide to the truncation of the virtual space. In this work this approach is tested for the first time for the calculation of higher-order response properties, particularly frequency-dependent dipole polarizabilities using coupled-cluster theory. We find that such properties are much more sensitive to the truncation of virtual space in the NO basis than in the original canonical molecular orbital (CMO) basis, with truncation errors increasing linearly with respect to the number of frozen virtual NOs. The reasons behind this poor performance include the more diffuse nature of NOs with low occupation numbers as well as the reduction in sparsity of the perturbed singl...},

The degree of spatial overlap between the occupied and virtual orbitals involved in an excitation is measured using a quantity Lambda, and the extent to which excitation energy errors correlate with Lambda is quantified. For a set of 59 excitations of local, Rydberg, and intramolecular charge-transfer character in 18 theoretically challenging main-group molecules, CAM-B3LYP provides by far the best overall performance; no correlation is observed between excitation energy errors and Lambda, reflecting the good quality, balanced description of all three categories of excitation. By contrast, a clear correlation is observed for the GGA and, to a lesser extent, the hybrid functional, allowing a simple diagnostic test to be proposed for judging the reliability of a general excitation from these functionals--when Lambda falls below a prescribed threshold, excitations are likely to be in very significant error. The study highlights the ambiguous nature of the term "charge transfer," providing insight into the observation that while many charge-transfer excitations are poorly described by GGA and hybrid functionals, others are accurately reproduced.},

abstract = {Properties of four chiral compounds-(S)- methyloxirane, (S)-methylthiirane, (S)-2-chloropropionitrile, and (M)-dimethylallene-centered in a solvation shell of six to seven water molecules have been computed using time-dependent density functional theory at several wavelengths using a many-body expansion. Interaction energies, total system dipole moments, and dynamic dipole polarizabilities converge rapidly and smoothly, exhibiting only minor oscillations with higher-body contributions. At three-body truncation of the expansion, errors in such properties as compared to the full cluster typically fall to less than 1 {\%} (and much smaller in most cases). Specific optical rotations, however, are found to converge much more slowly and erratically, requiring five-body contributions to obtain errors less than 5 {\%} in three of four test cases, and six-body terms for (S)-methylthiirane. The source of this behavior is found to be the wide variation of both magnitude and sign of the specific rotation with changes in the configuration of individual solute/solvent clusters. Thus, unlike simpler properties such as energies or dipole moments, where each fragment makes a small, same-sign contribution to the total property, specific rotations typically involve much larger contributions that partly cancel in the many-body expansion. Thus, the computational costs of molecular dynamics simulations of explicit solvation, for example, will be only partially alleviated by such expansions. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract = {Coupled cluster (CC) and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of optical rotation, [alpha](lambda), have been carried out for the difficult case of (S)-methyloxirane for comparison to recently published gas-phase cavity ringdown polarimetry data. Both theoretical methods are exquisitely sensitive to the choice of one-electron basis set, and diffuse functions have a particularly large impact on the computed values of [alpha](lambda). Furthermore, both methods show a surprising sensitivity to the choice of optimized geometry, with [alpha](355) values varying by as much as 15 deg dm(-1) (g/mL)(-1) among molecular structures that differ only negligibly. Although at first glance the DFT/B3LYP values of [alpha](355) appear to be superior to those from CC theory, the success of DFT in this case appears to stem from a significant underestimation of the lowest (Rydberg) excitation energy in methyloxirane, resulting in a shift of the first-order pole in [alpha](lambda) (the Cotton effect) towards the experimentally chosen incident radiation lines. This leads to a fortuitous positive shift in the value of [alpha](355) towards the experimental result. The coupled cluster singles and doubles model, on the other hand, correctly predicts the position of the absorption pole (to within 0.05 eV of the experimental result), but fails to describe correctly the shape/curvature of the ORD region lambda=355, resulting in an incorrect prediction of both the magnitude and the sign of the optical rotation.},

Our original method included up to two-or three-body Coulomb, exchange, and correlation energies exactly and higher-order Coulomb energies in the dipole-dipole interaction approximation. In this work, the dipole moments are replaced by atom-centered point charges determined so that they reproduce the electrostatic potentials of the cluster subunits accurately and also self-consistently with one another in the cluster environment. They have been shown to lead to a dramatic improvement in the description of short-range electrostatic potentials not only of large, charge-separated subunits such as zwitterionic glycine but also of small subunits. Furthermore, basis set superposition errors ͑BSSEs͒ have been eliminated by combining the Valiron–Mayer function counterpoise ͑VMFC͒ correction with our binary or ternary interaction method. A new BSSE-correction scheme has been proposed on this basis, wherein three-body and all higher-order Coulomb effects on BSSE are also estimated. The BSSE-corrected ternary interaction method with atom-centered point charges reproduces the VMFC-corrected results within 0.1 kcal/ mol.

abstract = {The differences between three previously defined counterpoise (CP) schemes for removing the BSSE in molecular complexes formed by more than two subunits have been assessed by CP-corrected geometry optimizations and frequency calculations for the hydrogen fluoride trimer and tetramer. The types of the functional counterpoise (FC) procedures included the site-site (SSFC), pairwise additive, and hierarchical Valiron-Mayer (VMFC) schemes. The latter approach takes into account the basis set extension of the dimers in the trimer, dimers and trimers in the tetramer, etc. The number of different calculations required to apply this counterpoise scheme increases very rapidly with the cluster size. The symmetry of the chosen systems makes the test of this approach computationally feasible. All the optimizations and frequency calculations have been carried out automatically using a new program that generates the necessary input files and repeatedly calls a slightly modified version of a Gaussian link. The results show that geometrical parameters, zero-point vibrational energies, and redshifts computed on the CP-corrected potential energy surfaces differ considerably from those evaluated on the uncorrected surfaces. The structural and energetic properties obtained with the conventional SSFC procedure are almost identical to those predicted by the more costly and complex VMFC method. Hence, the former seems to be more appropriate in the present case. Furthermore, symmetry-adapted perturbation theory calculations show the importance of computing the interaction energies at the CP-corrected geometries. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

The general theory has been applied to the calculation of a large number of spectroscopic parameters over the years, and it has been implemented for the majority of standard electronic structure methods. Two formulations of response theory, the Ehrenfest expectation value and the quasi-energy derivative formulation, have turned into leading alternatives for the derivation of computationally tractable expressions of response functions, and they are here reviewed with an attempt to, as far as possible, leave out technical details. A set of four steps are identified as common in derivations of response functions, and the two formulations are compared along this series of steps. Particular emphasis is given to the situation when the oscillation of the weak external electromagnetic field is in resonance with a transition frequency of the system. The formation of physically sound response functions in resonance regions of the spectrum is discussed in light of the causality condition and the Kramers-Kronig relations, and it is achieved in wave function theory by means of the introduction of relaxation parameters in a manner that mimics what one sees in density matrix theory. As a working example, equations are illustrated by their application to a two-state model for para-nitroaniline including the ground and the lowest charge-transfer state in the electric dipole approximation.},

In this work, all 1-body through N-body interactions are obtained from CCSD(T) computations, and the higher-order interactions are captured at the MP2 level. The linear expressions from the many-body expansion facilitate a straightforward evaluation of geometrical derivative properties (e.g., gradients and Hessians). For (H2O)n clusters (n = 3-7), optimized structures obtained with the 2-body:Many-body CCSD(T):MP2 method are virtually identical to CCSD(T) optimized geometries. Harmonic vibrational frequencies calculated with this 2-body:Many-body approach differ from CCSD(T) frequencies by at most a few cm(-1). These deviations can be systematically reduced by including more terms from the many-body expansion at the CCSD(T) level. Maximum deviations between CCSD(T) and 3-body:Many-body CCSD(T):MP2 frequencies are typically only a few tenths of a cm(-1) for the H2O clusters examined in this work. These results are obtained at a fraction of the wall time of the supermolecular CCSD(T) computation, and the approach is well-suited for parallelization on relatively modest computational hardware.},

abstract = {Fragment-based methods promise accurate energetics at a cost that scales linearly with the number of fragments. This promise is founded on the premise that the many-body expansion (or another similar energy decomposition) needs to only consider spatially local many-body interactions. Experience and chemical intuition suggest that typically at most four-body interactions are required for high accuracy. Bettens and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014 9, 3699—3707] published a detailed study showing that for moderately sized water clusters, basis set superposition error (BSSE) undermines this premise. Ultimately, they were able to overcome BSSE by performing all computations in the supersystem basis set, but such a solution destroys the reduced computational scaling of fragment-based methods. Their findings led them to suggest that there is “trouble with the many-body expansion”. Since then, a subsequent follow-up study from Bettens and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory. Comput. 2015, 11, 5132–5143] as well a...},

abstract = {Longstanding conventional wisdom dictates that the widely used Many-Body Expansion (MBE) converges rapidly by the four-body term when applied to large chemical systems. We have found, however, that this is not true for calculations using many common, moderate-sized basis sets such as 6-311++G** and aug-cc-pVDZ. Energy calculations performed on water clusters using these basis sets showed a deceptively small error when the MBE was truncated at the three-body level, while inclusion of four- and five-body contributions drastically increased the error. Moreover, the error per monomer increases with system size, showing that the MBE is unsuitable to apply to large chemical systems when using these basis sets. Through a systematic study, we identified the cause of the poor MBE convergence to be a many-body basis set superposition effect exacerbated by diffuse functions. This was verified by analysis of MO coefficients and the behavior of the MBE with increasing monomer–monomer separation. We also found poor con...},

Through the well-established ``quasi-energy'' approach, we demonstrate the connection between the analytic derivative and response approaches, emphasizing the usefulness of the latter for frequency-dependent chiroptical properties. In addition, we review successes of response theory in the prediction of gas-phase specific rotations and electronic circular dichroism spectra for small molecules and the physical requirements of a robust computational model of such properties.

The binding energy, or total energy, of the cluster may be broken down into many smaller subcluster calculations and the energies of these subsystems linearly combined to, hopefully, produce the desired quantity of interest. Unfortunately, BSSE can plague these smaller fragment calculations. In this work, we carefully examine the major sources of error associated with reproducing the binding energy and total energy of a molecular cluster. In order to do so, we decompose these energies in terms of a many-body expansion (MBE), where a “body” here refers to the monomers that make up the cluster. In our analysis, we found it necessary to introduce something we designate here as a many-ghost many-body expansion (MGMBE).

In particular, we have investigated the performance of a wave function-theory-in-density-functional-theory (WFT-in-DFT) FDE approach for computing such properties for the small, rigid chiral compound (P)-dimethylallene interacting with up to three water molecules. Although the solvent potential is obtained through DFT, the optical response is computed using coupled cluster linear response theory for mixed electric and magnetic field perturbations. We find that the FDE potential generally yields too small a shift from the isolated molecule as compared to that introduced by the explicit solvent. In one case, the FDE potential fails to reproduce a change in sign of the ORD in which the solute interacts with two solvent molecules. The source of these errors is due primarily to the lack of solvent response to the external field and is analyzed in terms of solvent–solute charge transfer excitations.},

abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Alml{\"{o}}f, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml{\"{o}}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99{\%} of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50{\%} more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94{\%}–97{\%} of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

abstract = {Electronic structure methods based on low-order " n-body " expansions are an increasingly popular means to defeat the highly nonlinear scaling of ab initio quantum chemistry calculations, taking advantage of the inherently distributable nature of the numerous subsystem calculations. Here, we examine how the finite precision of these subsystem calculations manifests in applications to large systems, in this case, a sequence of water clusters ranging in size up to (H 2 O) 47 . Using two different computer implementations of the n-body expansion, one fully integrated into a quantum chemistry program and the other written as a separate driver routine for the same program, we examine the reproducibility of total binding energies as a function of cluster size. The combinatorial nature of the n-body expansion amplifies subtle differences between the two implementations, especially for n ≥ 4, leading to total energies that differ by as much as several kcal/mol between two implementa-tions of what is ostensibly the same method. This behavior can be understood based on a propagation-of-errors analysis applied to a closed-form expression for the n-body expansion, which is derived here for the first time. Discrepancies between the two implementations arise primarily from the Coulomb self-energy correction that is required when electrostatic embedding charges are implemented by means of an external driver program. For reliable results in large systems, our analysis suggests that script-or driver-based implementations should read binary output files from an electronic structure program, in full double precision, or better yet be fully integrated in a way that avoids the need to compute the aforementioned self-energy. Moreover, four-body and higher-order expansions may be too sensitive to numerical thresholds to be of practical use in large systems.},

However, there are numerous such interactions to consider, and it is not obvious which ones are significant. We provide a general and fast method for establishing which small set of three- and four-body interactions are important. This is achieved by estimating the maximum many-body effects, ϵmax, that can arise in a given arrangement of bodies. Through careful analysis of ϵmax, we find two overall causes for significant many-body interactions. First, many-body induction propagates in nonbranching paths, that is, in a chain-like manner. Second, linear arrangements of bodies promote the alignment of the dipoles to reinforce the many-body interaction. Consequently, compact and extended linear arrangements are favored. The latter result is not intuitive as these linear arrangements can lead to significant many-body effects extending over large distances. For the first time, this study provides...},
